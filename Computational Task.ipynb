    "Given the data I have collected above, it is clear to me that the magnitude of changing the probability is larger than that of the number of offsprings, when it comes to reaching the master sequence.\n",

    "Probability (p):\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an optimum point around about the 0.025 region as shown by the results. In experiments 2 and 4, the number of offsprings were kept the same but p were 0.01 and 0.05, it took these an average of 54972 and 40899 respectively across 8 trials, whereas in experiment 12 where p = 0.25, the average was significantly lower at 28663. This leads me to think that the probability is a normal distribution where the mean is somewhere between 0.05 and 0.01. This is further proven by the fact that when p < 0.01 and p > 0.05 the number of generations increase until a point where it takes too many generations to come to the master sequence.\n",

    "My initial thoughts were that the more offsprings made in each generation, the lower the number of generations needed to reach the master sequence. However this did not seem to be the case. Experiments 4, 5 and 6 shows a slight increase in the number of generations taken despite the the number of offsprings being raised from 20 to 50 to 150. There is either a very weak positive correlation or no correlation at all between the number of offsprings and the number of generations needed to reach the master sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These trends described are not conclusive as only 7 trials for each case were completed. There are also limitations with the efficiency of my code and laptop used meaning I am unable to go beyond certain cases to obtain results, examples of this are experiments 9 and 10 where it took too much time to conduct the full study to retrieve all necessary results."
